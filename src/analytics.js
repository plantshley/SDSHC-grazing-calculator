/**
 * GA4, and the four rules that keep it out of everything else's way.
 *
 *   1. **Nothing a producer typed ever leaves the device.** Only structure goes
 *      out: which worksheet, which step, which option, which definition. The
 *      figures, the pasture names and the saved records stay here. That is what
 *      the `privacy` definition and `.footer-privacy` promise, so a new call to
 *      `track()` carrying a number somebody entered breaks a written promise and
 *      not merely a convention.
 *   2. **It never throws and never blocks.** Every entry point is wrapped, and a
 *      failure is swallowed. Analytics that can break the calculator is worse
 *      than no analytics.
 *   3. **Production on the real host only.** `npm run dev` and a local preview
 *      send nothing, so the reports are not half your own testing.
 *   4. **`calc.js` never learns this file exists.** The models stay pure. Every
 *      call is made from `main.js` or from a `ui/` module.
 *
 * Offline: `gtag.js` is cross-origin and is deliberately NOT precached, so an
 * offline session records nothing at all. That is expected, not a bug. See the
 * reference guide.
