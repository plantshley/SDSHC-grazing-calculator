/**
 * Theme Lab — a hidden palette editor. Author tool, not a producer feature.
 *
 * Opens on a secret gesture (see OPENING below) and shows one control per
 * colour token in styles.css, so a palette can be tried on the real app rather
 * than in a swatch grid. Nothing here is linked to from any screen.
 *
 * Five things it deliberately does:
 *
 * 1. IT WRITES INLINE CUSTOM PROPERTIES on <html>, never a stylesheet. An
 *    inline declaration beats both `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]` without
 *    caring which of them supplied the value, so one mechanism covers both
 *    themes and removing the property restores the shipped colour exactly.
 *
 * 2. IT KEEPS A SET PER THEME. --bg is two different colours and editing under
 *    one theme must not follow you into the other. A MutationObserver on
 *    data-theme re-applies the right set, so the app's own toggle works
 *    normally while the panel is open.
 *
 * 3. IT MIRRORS A LIGHT EDIT INTO DARK, by copying the RELATIONSHIP the
 *    shipped pair already has rather than by inverting anything. See MIRRORING.
 *
 * 4. IT GROUPS TOKENS THAT SHARE A COLOUR. --green and --save are one green;
 *    editing them separately is how they drift apart. See CLUSTERS.
 *
 * 5. IT FOLLOWS THE THEME TOGGLE WITHOUT READING THE THEME'S TOKENS. The panel
 *    has a light scheme and a dark one of its own, both hardcoded, switched by
 *    the same [data-theme] the app switches on. So it sits the right way round
 *    beside the page — but it cannot be made unreadable by the edit you are
 *    trying to undo. Wiring it to --card and --text would read as tidier and
 *    would mean that setting --text near --card leaves you unable to see the
 *    control that puts it back. Its own colours are --tl-* names, declared on
 *    .tl-panel rather than on :root, and no --tl-* name is in ALL_TOKENS.
 *
 * 6. IT KEEPS A SHELF OF NAMED PALETTES, on a second tab. Saving copies the
 *    working palette onto the shelf and applying copies one back over it;
 *    neither merges, and resetting the page never empties the shelf. See
 *    THE SHELF. A theme's Copy CSS and the paste box on the same tab are the
 *    round trip between one browser and another; see IMPORTING A PASTE.
 *
 * It does not persist into the calculation. Overrides live under one
 * localStorage key of their own and are not preferences, not calculation state,
 * and not carried by an export or a backup.
 *
 * Caveat worth knowing before you read a result: three tokens ship as `var()`
 * aliases (--info -> --sky, and --brand-ink and --on-olive -> --brown under
 * light). The pickers below start from the RESOLVED colour, and overriding one
 * of them breaks the alias for as long as the override is set. In practice the
 * clustering hides this, since an alias lands in the same cluster as what it
 * aliases and both move together.
 *
 * Shared with SDSHC-farm-budget, which is where it came from, in the same way
 * styles.css is: it edits the shared design system's tokens and the two copies
 * should not drift. This app declares no --placeholder, so that row is the one
 * deliberate difference between them.

/* ── MIRRORING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   A light edit is carried into dark by copying the RELATIONSHIP the shipped
   pair already has, not by inverting anything. Two models, chosen per token by
   how far apart the shipped pair sits:

     FLIP (|dL| >= 0.25)   L' = Ld + Ll - Ln
       The pair is a surface/ink that swaps ends — --bg #f7f9f7 -> #14181a,
       --text #222 -> #e7ecea. Darkening the light one lightens the dark one,
       which is what a theme flip means.

     SHIFT (|dL| < 0.25)   L' = Ln + (Ld - Ll)
       The pair is an accent that only nudges — --sky #0fb2e2 -> #4fc9ef, and
       every card ink, which does not move at all. A flip model here would
       send a mid-tone accent to white.

   Colour is carried two ways at once and the two are BLENDED, by how much
   chroma the light end has to be trusted for:

     POLAR      chroma takes the shipped RATIO, hue the shipped ROTATION.
       --sky loses a little saturation going dark and that should hold whatever
       hue you move it to. Right for a colour that is actually a colour.

     CARTESIAN  the shipped a/b OFFSET is added instead.
       --bg, --card and --text are greys, and both a ratio and a rotation
       between two near-zero chromas are noise amplified. An offset of nearly
       nothing is nearly nothing, which is the right answer for a grey.

   The weight is a smoothstep between CHROMA_LO and CHROMA_HI, and it is a
   RAMP rather than the threshold this started as. The threshold shipped a bug:
   --brand-ink is #4e413a against #dfe6e2, two browns so close to grey that
   their hues are meaningless, but its light chroma is 0.021 — a thousandth over
   the old floor. So it took the polar branch and applied the 111 degrees of
   rotation sitting between two greys as though it meant something, and a purple
   heading colour came back as clay brown. Nothing about the input said the
   answer was junk; 0.021 and 0.019 are the same colour and were treated as
   different kinds of thing.

   Both models are exact at the base point on their own, so any blend of them
   is exact too: leave the light colour where it shipped and the dark one lands
   on the exact hex in styles.css, at every weight. That is asserted, not
   assumed. Alpha carries the shipped ratio throughout, which is what takes
   --overlay from 0.45 to 0.6 and --olive-soft from 0.35 to 0.18.

   This is a good guess, not a designer. A mirrored dark theme wants looking at
   before it is believed; every mirrored row is editable, and editing one pins
   it so no later light edit overwrites it.

/* ── THE SHELF ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   A saved theme is a frozen copy of the working palette under a name. Saving
   copies out of the working set, applying copies back over it, and neither
   merges: a half-applied theme showing three of its colours and four of the
   last one's is a palette nobody chose and cannot be reasoned about.

   Two consequences worth knowing:

   RESET NEVER TOUCHES THE SHELF. "Reset both" clears what is on the page. It is
   the button you press to see the shipped colours again, several times an
   evening, and if it also emptied a shelf of named work that would be the one
   irreversible action in a tool whose whole point is that everything is
   reversible.

   APPLYING OVER UNSAVED EDITS ASKS FIRST. Applying is how you switch between
   themes and has to be one press; it is only the unsaved case that needs a
   second one, so the button asks only when there is actually something to lose.

/* ── IMPORTING A PASTE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The shelf is one localStorage key in one browser. Copy CSS gets a theme out
   of it and this gets one back in, which is the only way a palette built on a
   laptop reaches a phone.

   What it accepts is deliberately wider than what it emits: a `:root` block, a
   `[data-theme="dark"]` block, both, a bare list of declarations with no block
   around them, or a whole styles.css with a hundred other rules in it. Every
   one of those is something somebody will actually paste, and a paste that is
   ALMOST right failing with "invalid" teaches nothing.

   What it refuses is narrower than that and says so every time:

   A NAME THIS APP DOES NOT USE is dropped and counted. Keeping it would put a
   dead declaration in the store that no swatch can reach, that applyAll() never
   writes, and that Copy CSS would then hand to the next browser along.

   A VALUE THAT IS NOT A COLOUR is dropped and counted, on a token that holds
   one. `var(--sky)` is allowed through because it is a real declaration that
   resolves; `#gg0011` is not.

   IT LANDS ON THE SHELF, NOT ON THE PAGE. A paste is a blob nobody can see
   until it renders, and applying it straight over the working palette would
   throw away whatever was being worked on to make room for it. Press Apply.

   A NAME ALREADY IN USE GETS A NUMBER rather than overwriting. Save overwrites
   on a name match because you can see what you are saving; a paste is exactly
   the case where you cannot.
